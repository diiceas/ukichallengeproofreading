As you remember, the first principle in the talk was to "Focus on language content that is relevant to you". Does it correlate to your current way of learning English? Any ideas on how you can apply this principle to your life?
	* 
This principal principle was correlating to my way of learning language when I was working at international IT-company and learning business English with private teacher at the same time. Conserning to my todays learning it is quite dificult issue how to implement this approach into learning process, becouse because English isnt necessary part of my regular life, I use it only at special meetings. Nevertheless im trying to learn new words trough repeating and memorising. I have partner, with whom we choose a list of new words weekly and then practice them during skypecalls. Perhaps its kind of 1st principal, becouse because i have to remember smth, what i wiil need and use in onversation with my partner. So if you dont have necessity of English, just create it. For instance you can promise with your partner to eachother, you will learn some new words to next conversation. And this skype call will be useless if you dont learn these words. Such agreements can inspire.


Do you find the idea of getting a Foreign Language Parent exciting? Have you got a possibility of practicing your English with such a person in real life already?

The idea of getting a Foreign Language Parent exist as the speacher told. Whether does it work? It is intresting, but I dont know, i didnt try. "such a person"? What kind of person do you mean? If we are talking about somebody with whom i can practice English, i will answer: yes, i have.
