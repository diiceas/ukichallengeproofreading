As you remember, the first principle in the talk was to "Focus on language content that is relevant to you". Does it correlate to your current way of learning English? Any ideas on how you can apply this principle to your life?
	* 
This principle was correlating to my way of language learning when I was working at the international IT-company and learning business English with a private teacher at the same time. Concerning my today's learning, it is quite difficult to integrate this approach into the learning process because English isn't a necessary part of my daily life, I use it only at special meetings. Nevertheless, I try to learn new words by repeating and memorizing them. I have a partner with whom we choose a list of new words weekly and then practice them during skype calls. Perhaps, its a kind of 1st principle because I have to remember smth that I will need and use in conversation with my partner. So, if you don't have a necessity of English, just create it. For instance, with your partner, you can promise to each other that you will learn some new words by the next conversation. And this skype call will be useless if you don't learn these words. Such agreements can inspire.


Do you find the idea of getting a Foreign Language Parent exciting? Have you got a possibility of practicing your English with such a person in real life already?

The idea of getting a Foreign Language Parent exist as the speacher told. Whether does it work? It is intresting, but I dont know, i didnt try. "such a person"? What kind of person do you mean? If we are talking about somebody with whom i can practice English, i will answer: yes, i have.
